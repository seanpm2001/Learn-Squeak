{"About:"}
{"I decided to make Squeak the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Squeak) as Squeak is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Squeak programming language. It only makes sense to Squeak the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."}
